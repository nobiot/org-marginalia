;;; Commentary:

;; This package lets you write margin notes (marginalia) for any text file in
;; a separate Org file.

;;;; Installation

;;;;; MELPA

;; This package is not available on MELPA. Manual installation required.

;;;;; Manual

;; Install these required packages:

;; Ensure to have Org Mode 9.4 or later (tested on 9.4).  This package uses
;; `org-collect-keywords', which does not exist in an earlier version.

;; Then put this file in your load-path, and put this in your init
;; file:
;; (require 'org-marginalia)

;;;; Usage

;; - `org-marginalia-mode' ::
;; Org-marginalia is a local minor mode. Toggle it on/off with using
;; `org-marginalia-mode'. On activating, it loads your saved highlighters from
;; the marginalia file, and enables automatic saving of highlighters. The
;; automatic saving is achieved via function `org-marginalia-save' added to
;; `after-save-hook'.

;; - `org-marginalia-mark' (C-c n m by default) ::
;; Select a region of text, and call `org-marginalia-mark' (bound to C-c n m by default)
;; to highlight the region. It will generate a new ID, and start tracking the
;; location -- so you can edit text around the marked text. Do not copy and
;; paste as it will disappear and it is a bit tricky to recover the
;; highlighter. To create a new margin note entry in themarginalia file, save the buffer.

;; - `org-marginalia-save' ::
;; By default, Org-marginalia creates or updates the highlighter's location
;; and text inside automatically in the marginalia file. You can manually call
;; `org-marginalia-save' to manually do it (automatic process also call this command).

;; - `org-marginalia-open' (C-c o by default) ::
;; Move your cursor on the highlighted text, and call `org-marginalia-open' to open the
;; relevant margin notes in a separate window. Your cursor should move to the
;; marginalia buffer narrowed to the relevant margin notes entry. You can edit
;; the margin notes as a normal Org file. Once you have done editing, you can
;; simply save and close the buffer (kill or close the window) as per your
;; normal workflow. Technically, the marginalia buffer is a cloned indirect
;; buffer of the marginalia file.

;; - `org-marginalia-load' ::
;; This command open the marginalia file and load the saved highlights onto
;; current buffer. If there is no margin notes for it, it will output a
;; message in the echo. Highlights tracked locally by this packages cannot
;; persist when you kill the buffer, or quit Emacs. When you re-launch Emacs,
;; ensure to turn on `org-marginalia-mode' to load the highlights. Load is
;; automatically done when you activate the minor mode.

;; - `org-marginalia-remove' ::
;; This command removes the highlight at point. It will remove the highlight,
;; and remove the properties from the marginalia, but will keep the headline
;; and notes in tact.

;; - `org-marginalia-next' (C-c n ] by default) ::
;; Move to the next highlight if any. If there is none below the cursor, and
;; there is a highlight above, loop back to the top one.

;; If the point has moved to the next highlight, this function enables
;; transient map with `set-transient-map'. You don't have to press the
;; keybinding prefix again to move further to the next. That is, you can do a
;; key sequence like this (assuming `org-marginalia-next' is bound to C-c n):

;;   C-c n ] ] ] ]

;; If you have the same prefix for `org-marginalia-prev', you can combine it in the
;; sequence like so:

;;  C-c n ] ] [ [
;;  This lets your cursor back to where you started (next next prev prev)

;; - `org-marginalia-prev' (C-c n [ by default) :: Move to the previous highlight if any.
;; If there is none above the cursor, and there is a highlight below, loop
;; back to the bottom one. This function enables transient map. See `org-marginalia-next'
;; for detail.

;; - `org-marginalia-toggle' ::
;; Toggle showing/hiding of highlighters in current buffer. It only affects
;; the display of the highlighters. When hidden, highlights' locations are
;; still kept tracked; thus, upon buffer-save the correct locations are still
;; recorded in the marginalia file.

;;;; Customizing

;; - Highlighter face can be changed via `org-marginalia-highlighter'
;; - Marginalia file is defined with `org-marginalia-notes-file-path'

;;;; Known Limitations

;; - Turning off minor mode does not turn off the highlighters
;;   This should not do any harm, but if you are distracted, kill the buffer
;;   (not revert) and visit it again. Toggling show/hide of highlighters is
;;   something I - would like to add later.

;; - Copy & pasting loses highlights
;;   You could mqanually recover it by adjusting the properties in the
;;   marginalia file.

;;;; Credits

;; To create this package, I was inspired by the following packages. I did not
;; copy any part of them, but borrowed some ideas from them -- e.g. saving the
;; margin notes in a separate file.

;; - [[https://github.com/jkitchin/ov-highlight][ov-highlight]]
;;   John Kitchin's (author of Org-ref). Great UX for markers with hydra.
;;   Saves the marker info and comments directly within the Org file as Base64
;;   encoded string. It uses overlays.

;; - [[https://github.com/bastibe/annotate.el][Annotate.el]]
;;   Bastian Bechtold's (author of Org-journal). Unique display of annotations
;;   right next to (or on top of) the text. It seems to be designed for very
;;   short annotations, and perhaps for code review (programming practice); I
;;   have seen recent issues reported when used with variable-pitch fonts
;;   (prose).

;; - [[https://github.com/tkf/org-mode/blob/master/contrib/lisp/org-annotate-file.el][Org-annotate-file]]
;;   Part of Org's contrib library. It seems to be designed to annotate a
;;   whole file in a separate Org file, rather than specific text items

;; - [[https://github.com/IdoMagal/ipa.el][InPlaceAnnotations (ipa-mode)]]
;;   It looks similar to Annotate.el above

    "Highlight text, write margin notes for any text file in Org Mode.

This command toggles Org-marginalia local minor mode. On
activation, it loads your saved highlights from the marginalia
file, and enables automatic saving of highlights.

The automatic saving is achieved via function `org-marginalia-save' added
to `after-save-hook'.

Interactively with no argument, this command toggles the mode. A
positive prefix argument enables the mode, any other prefix
argument disables it. From Lisp, argument omitted or nil enables
the mode, `toggle' toggles the state.
